This is a readme file. It typically includes some information about your project.
For more information about readmes, you can either [read a guide](https://github.com/18F/open-source-guide/blob/18f-pages/pages/making-readmes-readable.md) or have a look at the readmes of popular open-source projects such as [Swift by Apple](https://github.com/apple/swift) or [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).

Readme files are typically formatted in Markdown.
However, there are platform-specific flavors, so for this project, you can make full use of the [Gitlab markdown syntax](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html), for example when talking about a :bug: (bug) or if your code is slow like a :snail:.
You can also tag people using @username and reference issues using '#1', where 1 is the issue number. For more features, consult the linked Gitlab syntax guide.

If you don't like reading documentation, [here's a cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

# Kniffeliger

Kniffeliger is a multiplayer computer game inspired by the classic [Kniffel](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kniffel) (also known as [Yahtzee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee) ). Apart from being fully computer-based and offering remote multiplayer capability, it offers additional game rules compared to its analogue antetype.

## Implementation

Kniffeliger is implemented in [Java 19.0](https://dev.java) in a [client-server architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client–server_model). The server handles the game logic and tracks the state of (multiple) games of a maximum of 4 players. The client provides a graphical user interface (GUI) and handles communication with the server in the background.
