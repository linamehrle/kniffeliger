TUE, 5.3.24 (Team Meeting)

Dear Diary
Today we had our first team meeting - how exciting!
First we assigned the tasks of milestone 1. You can see the assignments below:

MILESTON 1 ASSIGNMENTS:
Lina: About a Game + (advanced), Requirement of the Game, Process, Requirements
Riccardo: Ahead of Schedule and Under Budget
Anisja: Ahead of Schedule and Under Budget, Dear Diary, Mockup, Who?/What?/When? + (advanced)
Dominique: Networking

NAME OF THE GAME:
Then we talked about the name. We all agreed to the name: Kniffliger (it is funny because the original game is
called Kniffel).

PRESENTATION:
Lina started already with a great presentation which we went through and talked about.

RULES OF THE GAME:
Then we talked about all the rules of our game, which is an extension of kniffel/yatzy. We brainstormed about how
we can improve the existing game
- Changing probabilities when a specific sum is rolled with the dices.
- 4 players at most.
- When a player rolls the dices and the sum of the dice is divisible by 5, then the player can roll a dices for an
  action:
    - Shifting entries (the entry sheets go around).
    - Steal the entries of other players. This entry gets crossed by the person you steal from.
    - Freeze entries of other players.
    - Switch entries.
    - Block a person from rolling the dices. This person needs to cross an entry.
    - action 6.

PLAN OF THE PROJECTS:
- Networking: Dominique, Lina
- Game Logic: Riccardo, Anisja
- Testing: Riccardo, Anisja (Unit-Tests)
- GUI: Lina, Dominique
- Gradle: (next week after we had the exercise lesson about Gradle)
- Project Management and Documentation: Anisja
- Police Officer: Riccardo

Until next time!

TUE, 5.3.24 (Anisja)

Dear Diary

After our team meeting I went around and asks for advice of people who coded their own game in the past. Here are the
tips and tricks:

- Basic structures should be accessible to all classes. Nico: "If you write a method think about weather other people
  need to use this method in other parts of the project and write a general version of it (so they can use it)."
- Networking: commands as enums (or ask tutors how they want this)

Until next time!

THU, 7.3.24 (Anisja)

Dear Diary

Today Riccardo and I had a mini-meeting. We talked about the plan for the game logic. We agreed on a basic logic and
some basic features we can already start coding. So we can start now!

Until next time!

SUN, 10.3.24 (Anisja)

Dear Diary

Today I finished the first version of out gantt project plan. I do not know, if it is like the tutors would like it, but
I tried my best. I also finished the comics of out group and of the server-client architecture for out presentation.
Maybe I can start coding a little today.

Until next time!

TUE, 12.3.24 (tutoring lesson, Lina/Riccardo/Anisja)

Dear Diary

Today we had the tutoring lesson and learnt a few new things. I write it down for you, so we do not forget this and also
you have the important information too:

- If we use libraries it is important to check first if it is supported by gradle (mavencentral).
- check the presentation which is on java.
- use hamachi for client server or in Spiegelgasse 1 (SSID: DMI PROGRAMMING
  passphrase: StudyingIT@unibas=reallyGreat2019)
- To avoid bugs: review codes (inspect function in intelliJ), unit-tests, GUI tests by hand, coding conventions (google
  coding conventions, check style) no manually wildcard imports: imports with *, one class per file, first all variables
  then all methods, camelCase for variables, never ignore exceptions: catch them, Housekeeping: test before committing
  and check everything weekly
- Javadoc: try to make it short ind informative

Hope this helps us to rock this project even more!

Until next time!

TUE, 12.3.24 (mini team meeting, Lina/Anisja)

Dear Diary

Lina and I talked about the game requirements and decided that we change things a little. Here are the new game rules:

- The change of probability of the dices got kicked out.
- 4 players at most.
- When a player rolls the dices and the sum of the dice is divisible by 5, then the player can roll a dices for an
  action:
    - Shifting entries (the entry sheets go around).
    - Steal the entries of other players. This entry gets crossed by the person you steal from.
    - Freeze entries of other players.
    - Switch entry sheets.
    - Block a person from rolling the dices. This person needs to cross an entry.
    - Jackpot: the person gets all actions above.

What is left to do:
1. Finish the presentation (Lina)
2. Write the concept: About a Game (Anisja)
3. Review Gantt plan (Lina)
4. Write meaningful Code (Lina/Riccardo/Anisja)
5. Finish drawings (Anisja)
