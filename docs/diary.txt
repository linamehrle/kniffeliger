TUE, 5.3.24 (Team Meeting)

Dear Diary
Today we had our first team meeting - how exciting!
First we assigned the tasks of milestone 1. You can see the assignments below:

MILESTON 1 ASSIGNMENTS:
Lina: About a Game + (advanced), Requirement of the Game, Process, Requirements
Riccardo: Ahead of Schedule and Under Budget
Anisja: Ahead of Schedule and Under Budget, Dear Diary, Mockup, Who?/What?/When? + (advanced)
Dominique: Networking

NAME OF THE GAME:
Then we talked about the name. We all agreed to the name: Kniffliger (it is funny because the original game is
called Kniffel).

PRESENTATION:
Lina started already with a great presentation which we went through and talked about.

RULES OF THE GAME:
Then we talked about all the rules of our game, which is an extension of kniffel/Yahtzee. We brainstormed about how
we can improve the existing game
- Changing probabilities when a specific sum is rolled with the dices.
- 4 players at most.
- When a player rolls the dices and the sum of the dice is divisible by 5, then the player can roll a dices for an
  action:
    - Shifting entries (the entry sheets go around).
    - Steal the entries of other players. This entry gets crossed by the person you steal from.
    - Freeze entries of other players.
    - Switch entries.
    - Block a person from rolling the dices. This person needs to cross an entry.
    - action 6.

PLAN OF THE PROJECTS:
- Networking: Dominique, Lina
- Game Logic: Riccardo, Anisja
- Testing: Riccardo, Anisja (Unit-Tests)
- GUI: Lina, Dominique
- Gradle: (next week after we had the exercise lesson about Gradle)
- Project Management and Documentation: Anisja
- Police Officer: Riccardo

Until next time!

TUE, 5.3.24 (Anisja)

Dear Diary

After our team meeting I went around and asks for advice of people who coded their own game in the past. Here are the
tips and tricks:

- Basic structures should be accessible to all classes. Nico: "If you write a method think about weather other people
  need to use this method in other parts of the project and write a general version of it (so they can use it)."
- Networking: commands as enums (or ask tutors how they want this)

Until next time!

THU, 7.3.24 (Anisja)

Dear Diary

Today Riccardo and I had a mini-meeting. We talked about the plan for the game logic. We agreed on a basic logic and
some basic features we can already start coding. So we can start now!

Until next time!

SUN, 10.3.24 (Anisja)

Dear Diary

Today I finished the first version of out gantt project plan. I do not know if it is like the tutors would like it, but
I tried my best. I also finished the comics of out group and of the server-client architecture for out presentation.
Maybe I can start coding a little today.

Until next time!

TUE, 12.3.24 (tutoring lesson, Lina/Riccardo/Anisja)

Dear Diary

Today we had the tutoring lesson and learnt a few new things. I write it down for you, so we do not forget this, and so
you have the important information too:

- If we use libraries it is important to check first if it is supported by gradle (mavencentral).
- check the presentation which is on java.
- use hamachi for client server or in Spiegelgasse 1 (SSID: DMI PROGRAMMING
  passphrase: StudyingIT@unibas=reallyGreat2019)
- To avoid bugs: review codes (inspect function in intelliJ), unit-tests, GUI tests by hand, coding conventions (google
  coding conventions, check style) no manually wildcard imports: imports with *, one class per file, first all variables
  then all methods, camelCase for variables, never ignore exceptions: catch them, Housekeeping: test before committing
  and check everything weekly
- Javadoc: try to make it short ind informative

Hope this helps us to rock this project even more!

Until next time!

TUE, 12.3.24 (mini team meeting, Lina/Anisja)

Dear Diary

Lina and I talked about the game requirements and decided that we change things a little. Here are the new game rules:

- The change of probability of the dices got kicked out.
- 4 players at most.
- When a player rolls the dices and the sum of the dice is divisible by 5, then the player can roll a dices for an
  action:
    - Shifting entries (the entry sheets go around).
    - Steal the entries of other players. This entry gets crossed by the person you steal from.
    - Freeze entries of other players.
    - Switch entry sheets.
    - Block a person from rolling the dices. This person needs to cross an entry.
    - Jackpot: the person gets all actions above.

What is left to do:
1. Finish the presentation (Lina)
2. Write the concept: About a Game (Anisja)
3. Review Gantt plan (Lina)
4. Write meaningful Code (Lina/Riccardo/Anisja)
5. Finish drawings (Anisja)

SAT, 16.3.24 (Ansija)

Dear Diary

Sorry I haven't written you since Tuesday. Woah - that is too long. It has been a week full of action: Our MVP Riccardo
coded the echo server in just one evening (tuesday evening, so he was on fire) - it is probably because we were a little
late. Also, Lina finished her beautiful presentation with cool zoom effects on wednesday just an hour before the deadline.

We even had our first milestone presentation! Although we had technical problems, it was relatively okay. We were the
last group of that day so people were tired (we were too) but that also meant we did not have to answer nasty questions
about our game that we have no answer for. I think they liked the simplicity of the extension and that you can mock
other players. You need a special kind of humour to like that kind of stuff. Also, I think it was Maria that said it was
her favourite presentation of that day despite the technical problems that were totally not our fault.

During the break and after the lecture, we also asked Prof Schuldt, Maria and Raphael (I will call him Raphi from now
on, since we all know him outside of this lecture) if we are allowed to draw their faces on our action dice with silly
word plays like "Du bist so raphi-niert, dass du einen Eintrag klauen kannst!" and they said yes.
So there are only 3 more tutors to convince.

Since that day we have only fixed some git problems and I have been continuing coding the game logic. I focussed
especially on the game itself, even though we need to have the chat first. I wanted to do something fun first.
But I will start with the login/logout and the chat next week. After all, milestone 2 is in 9 days.

Until next time!

SUN, 17.3.24 (Anisja)

Dear Diary

OMG look at me, writing twice in a row - aren't you proud of me? Anyway, I just wanted to update you that I will be
seeing Lina tomorrow, and we will talk about the client-server-things and the network-stuff. She also needs to know what
the client needs to send the server when we see it from a pure game logic perspective. I will think about this tomorrow
morning. Tonight I finished the unit test for the EntrySheet and I will continue to set up a file with the class
structure for the game logic, so Riccardo knows what my thoughts were.

Enough about today because I also learnt THREE VERY IMPORTANT THINGS THIS WEEK:

1. Renato is Git-God, so if I have any questions, I can aks him.
2. IntelliJ has a local history. So if you are as stupid as me and delete the code you worked on all weekend, you can
   get it restored with the local history (File >> Local History >> Show History...).
3. There are many, many shortcuts you can take in IntelliJ, like when you are in a class you want to build a unit test for
   you can press CRTL + Shift + t which sets up a file with the class name + "Test" in the right directory. Pretty cool,
   huh?

Okay that is all for today. Sleep well and until next time!

TUE, 19.3.24 (Anisja)

Dear Diary

We received the points for milestone one, or should I say no points. That humbled us quickly. Also, I think not all the
negative points are valid. But they said our pen pal-ship is good, so we keep that going for sure. In this exercise
lesson, we went through the milestone 2 requirements and realised, that they definitely do not always put down every
requirement in their little list - how malicious! Anyway, talk to you soon!

Next step is: team meeting today. We will talk about game logic, networking and how bad milestone 1 was.
I will update you on the meeting later.

Until next time!

TUE, 19.3.24 (Team Meeting)

Dear Diary

Today we had a team meeting. We talked about the following things:
1.  We went through the milestone two requirements. Lina set up a cool google file on which we can assign the tasks to
    the single members.
2.  We also went through the milestone three requirements.
3.  We wrote an email to Rahel with our questions to milestone 1.

Next steps for our team:
- Lina: finishes networking.
- Dominique: tidies up files and starts looking into GUI programming.
- Riccardo: does handle the Gradle build file and the Log4j library.
- Anisja: continues game logic and writes down the necessary network protocol for the game logic and its integration.

Until next time!

THU, 21.3.24 (Anisja)

Dear Diary

Woah, exception handling is exhausting. I am going through my code to test it with "meaningful unit tests" and also to
catch those sneaky exceptions. That is a lot of work, but I think I will finish it by the end of today. I am also so
excited that Lina soon has her network protocol all ready, and we can merge my game logic with her code. This is going
to be the BEST PART because I will learn so, so much about networking and her code and I just love to work with her. I
got to finish my game logic first though - woopsie. I also got to finish my quality assurance concept for this milestone
and I think I already overdid it - double woopsie. I am also very excited for Dominique's work because he started to
implement the basic GUI. Riccardo did the Gradle stuff for this milestone. He also is the police officer of our dreams
(and our nightmares): he reminds us of important tasks, keeps us on track and gets on our nerves if we do sloppy work.
We love and hate it at the same time (but we love him for doing this). So, as you can tell, we are all totally invested
and super deeply committed to our roles (especially Riccardo*) and I am very, very grateful to have such cool,
hardworking, smart team members. It is so much fun working with them. <3

Until next time!

TUE, 26.3.24 (Anisja)

Dear Diary

Today we had the milestone 2 exercise lesson. I think it went well. Lina was very excited to show her amazing code and
the tutors also agreed that she did a very good job. It is so cool and almost magic, that the computers can now
communicate! Later, she went on to build the lobby and I continued on the game logic. I already have the game logic
of "kniffel" done, but the "iger" part is missing - aka the action dice. I tested it with unit tests and a main
method, and we played it on the console.

I am very excited for the feedback on milestone 2, but honestly: nothing can go wrong with Lina as our networking pro!

Until next time!

WED, 27.3.24 (Anisja)

Dear Diary

We code, we test, we stress,
until all tutors are impressed.
Yahtzee alone is a little lame
it would be a boring game.
That's why we add an action dice,
it will make the game really nice.

Until next time!

TUE, 02.4.24 (Lina)

Dear Diary

I decided that I just had to do an entry too for once. And I just wanted to say how good of a job Anisja is doing with you!
The entries are always so funny and creative (you´re the best gooorl <3).
So here is a poem just for her (sorry in advance):

I think that everyone can see
that Anisja is the real MVP
She´s not only funny and nice
but also gives the best advice
Always the smartest girl in the room
protects this project from certain doom
She always brings a smile to the face
and makes this world a better place

On a different note: we just had another exercise lesson and talked about the next milestone requirements. Beni was
amazing and very helpful as always! We got some good pointers for the next projects, and I am excited to continue
working.
Next Up: Team meeting later today to plan Milestone 3 and 4 and just get an update on what everyone has been doing in
general.

Until next time!

Dear Diary

I hope you had a good Easter weekend! Mine was pretty sleepy and stressful. I had to finish the action dice
implementation and boy was that a "gnusch"*. It really took longer than I thought. Even our police officer
agreed that it is quite the pain to implement the starter method, and he is wayyyyyy better in maths and coding and more
structured than I am (that is why he is the police officer...also because the gingers should definitely NOT be in
charge even though Lina would also be smart and structured enough).
Anywhoooo, like my students always say: 'Omagawd!!!' - I just finished fixing the bug in the delete method of my
GameManager, so I CAN MERGE Lina's and my code today!! Woop woop! I've always wondered what a child between Lina and I
will look like, and today we will finally find out! I bet our codes match as well as Lina and I do *wink at Lina*.

Until next time!

* that is Swiss German for "chaos"
