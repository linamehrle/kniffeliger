TUE, 5.3.24 (Team Meeting)

Dear Diary
Today we had our first team meeting - how exciting!
First we assigned the tasks of milestone 1. You can see the assignments below:

MILESTON 1 ASSIGNMENTS:

NAME OF THE GAME:
Then we talked about the name. We all agreed to the name: Kniffliger (it is funny because the original game is
called kniffel).

PRESENTATION:
Lina started already with a great presentation which we went through and talked about.

RULES OF THE GAME:
Then we talked about all the rules of our game, which is an extension of kniffel/yatzy. We brainstormed about how
we can improve the existing game
- Changing probabilities when a specific sum is rolled with the dices.
- 4 players at most.
- When a player rolls the dices and the sum of the dice is divisible by 5, then the player can roll a dice for an action:
    - Shifting entries (the entry sheets go around).
    - Steal the entries of other players. This entry gets crossed by the person you steal from.
    - Freeze entries of other players.
    - Switch entries.
    - Block a person from rolling the dices. This person needs to cross an entry.
    - action 6.
